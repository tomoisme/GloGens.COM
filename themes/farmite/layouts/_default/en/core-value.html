                        <p>We believe in supporting the land that God has given us. Our fertilizers don’t destroy the
                            Earth
                            that we’ve been blessed to receive but instead, support and nourish it. We think that it’s
                            important for us to partner with eco-friendly farmers and producers who also want to produce
                            a
                            clean, safe place to live that honors creation and future generations.</p>
