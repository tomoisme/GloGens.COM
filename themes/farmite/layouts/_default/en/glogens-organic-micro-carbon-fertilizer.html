                    <h2>Scientific Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        At face value, there’s nothing complicated about coal. It’s a combustible sedimentary rock that’s
                    formed from organic deposits - typically, the remains of plants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When plants die and are fossilized, those nutrients don’t just go away. Instead, they remain inside
                    coal, where they remain complete and balanced - just waiting to be unlocked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When coal is harvested, it contains 23 elements that are vital for plant growth. That’s more than
                    seven times what you’ll find in traditional fertilizers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You’ll get the best output from your plants by offering them plants themselves - but in a highly
                        digestible and usable form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our discovery with coal-based technology improves plant growth in a simple way. It activates the
                    latent nutrients in coal and makes it easier for plants to use. It’s a premium product with premium
                    results – but offered at an affordable price.

                    <h5>Basic Premise</h5>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. What is harvested is actually (23 elements) much more than what
                        is given to our plant
                        (3
                        elements).</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. The best output is actually aligned with the input. As with
                        plants, what is the best
                        for
                        plants actually comes from the plants themselves. So the best energy or fertilizer for
                        plants
                        comes from the plants. The best fertilizer is animal manure which is basically plants
                        remains
                        that has been digested, but it is difficult to produce on an industrial scale. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        3. Coal comes from fossilized plants and contains complete elements but with complex and
                        inert
                        beta
                        carbon chain. It needs to be simplify and activated so can be utilized by the plants.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        4. This process has been patented in Indonesia and pending patents in USA</p>

                    <h5>Elements in Coal</h5>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Coal is composed of complex mixtures of organic and inorganic compounds.
                        The organic compounds in coal are composed of a few elements but these compounds are
                        extremely
                        complex thus need to be simplified, while the nutrient is inert and needs to be
                        activated.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Analytical chemistry is one method used in research on coal quality with the purpose to
                        determine
                        inorganic elements and compounds to be best utilized by plants.
