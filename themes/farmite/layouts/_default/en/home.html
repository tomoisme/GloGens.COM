                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        We are a Global Green Energy Solutions Corporation located in Rocklin, California that
                        established in 2019 after signing exclusive partner rights with SGH (Saputra Global Harvest) for
                        the North American market.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        Our products are based on years of research and development that led to the patent of
                        <strong>two exclusive technologies</strong>
                        in The United States of America and Indonesia. We specialize in two
                        distinct processes. One of these processes forms essential nutrients for plants and animals, and
                        another that produces organic coal-based fertilizers.

                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        Essential nutrient formation technology has proven to enhance the natural functioning of plant
                        and animal cells. Similarly, coal-based fertilizer is a natural way to supply all of the
                        nutrients your plants need for improved production. It does this without <a

                        When used together, these technologies can dramatically increase crop yield and reduce your

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Conventional agriculture is at a crossroads. <br>
                        On the one hand, <a style="color:lime;"

                        recognizes that using synthetic fertilizers repeatedly is not a
                        good idea. A good fertilizer will supply nutrients that your plants need while also supporting
                        the life of microorganisms and good soil structure.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Soil health isn’t based on the presence of N-P-K alone - there are lots of variables required to
                        grow healthy crops.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        With our innovative technology and environmentally friendly products, farmers will now be able
                        to increase their production yields. You’ll have healthier crops and healthier soils – all while
                        saving thousands of dollars on production.

            <div class="col-lg-12 col-xl-12 left-layer">

                    <p class="text-b"><span class="glogens-trademark">GLOGENS®</span> Organic has taken advantage of these two patented unique processes that
                        offer the best of
                        both worlds.</p>

                    <p class="text-b">In our essential nutrient process, we looked at ways that we could improve yield
                        by using what
                        Mother Nature has already given us. Plants have everything they need to take care of themselves.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-b">But what if there was a way to improve yield by making them more efficient?</p>

                    <p class="text-b">Essential nutrients contain fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, minerals,
                        saccharides, and
                        oligosaccharides. All of these are elements needed by all living creatures to sustain growth.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-b">When this nutrient is added, a plant’s metabolic system becomes more efficient at
                        absorbing and
                        using things like water, sunlight, and air.</p>

                    <p class="text-b">For example, plants need glutamic acid to produce heavy yields. Amino acids by
                        themselves, though,
                        aren’t necessarily effective at boosting plant growth. It requires a unique blend of nutrients
                        and
                        precise methods of extraction to render these elements useful for plants.</p>
                
                    <p class="text-b">We have that technology - and bring it directly to you in a usable form in our
                        proprietary <span class="glogens-trademark">GLOGENS®</span>
                        Organic Micro-Carbon Fertilizer.</p>

                    <p class="text-b">But that’s not all. Our eco-friendly fertilizers also harness the natural power of
                        coal. Coal is the
                        result of the decomposition of plants as they become fossils.</p>

                    <p class="text-b">It contains all of the elements required by plants for growth - but not just any
                        old coal will do the
                        trick. You need to be able to activate the dormant nutrients that are locked inside.</p>

                    <p class="text-b"><span class="glogens-trademark">GLOGENS®</span> Organic Micro-Carbon Fertilizer is the only fertilizer with the ability
                        to do just that.</p>

                    <p class="text-b">Whether you’re looking to increase your yield without increasing your budget,
                        reduce your reliance on
                        chemicals, grow an organic dynamite crop, or simply improve soil health in a sustainable,
                        eco-friendly
                        way, <span class="glogens-trademark">GLOGENS®</span> Organic is the way to go.</p>
